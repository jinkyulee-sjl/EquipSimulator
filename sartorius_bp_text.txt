Operating the Balance
Warmup Time
To deliver exact results, the balance must warm up for at least 30 minutes after
connection to AC power or after a power outage. Only after this time will the
balance have reached the required operating temperature.
Turning the Display On and Off (Standby Mode)
Press the ekey (11)to turn the display on and off.
Self-Test
After the balance has been turned on, an automatic
self-test of the balance’s electronic circuitry is
performed. At the end of the self-test, a zero readout
(cid:2)
is displayed. This means that the balance is ready
to operate.
Important Note Concerning Verified Balances Approved for Use as Legal
Measuring Instruments in the EU*:
The last digit on the display is bordered when the verification scale interval “e”
is greater than the scale interval “d.”
The display shows the following special codes for your information:
o Odisplayed in the upper right corner stands for OFF
The balance was disconnected from AC power
(balance reconnected to AC power or power outage
longer than 3 seconds).
Odisplayed in the lower left corner means standby
o
The display has been turned off by the ekey (11).
The balance is now in the ready-to-operate mode and
does not require warmup.
b bmeans busy
Once you have turned on the balance, the bsymbol
will be displayed until you press a key. During
operation, this symbol indicates that the balance
processor is still busy processing a function and will not

The symbol nin the weight display (on the left)
shows that the balance is exactly tared to “Zero”
(±0.25 of a scale interval).
Simple Weighing (Weight Determination)
Place your sample on the weighing pan (1)to
determine the weight. Read off the weight indicated
on the display only after the weight unit “g”
or a different unit selected appears as the stability
symbol. You can find more information on the weight
units on page 33 under “Weight Units.”
Important Note Concerning Verified Balances
of Accuracy Class k
To avoid measuring errors, the respective air density
must be allowed for. The following formula is used to
calculate the mass of the sample:
1– ρ/8000 kg m–3
m = n L
w 1– ρ/ρ
L
m = mass of the sample
n = weight readout
w
ρ = air density during weighing
L
ρ = density of the sample

Calibration/Adjustment
During calibration1), the span of the balance is adjusted to the changes in
ambient conditions.
You must adjust or calibrate your new balance at the place of installation after
each warmup period and before the first measurement. You must also re-adjust
or recalibrate your balance each time you set it up in a different area or when
ambient conditions change (especially the temperature). Verified balances
approved for use as legal measuring instruments must be adjusted/calibrated
at least once a day.
The balance offers you various adjustment and calibration functions. You can
select these functions by setting the appropriate menu codes. For more information,
refer to “Balance Operating Menu.”
You can interrupt any adjustment or calibration function by pressing c(10).
Using Verified Balances as Legal Measuring Instruments in the EU*:
Before using your balance as a legal measuring instrument, you must carry
out an “Internal Calibration” operation at the place of installation after the
warmup period.

1) “Calibration” technically means to determine
the difference between the balance readout and
the actual weight on the pan to determine the
(cid:2) accuracy. Adjustment means to bring a balance
into the state of accuracy required for its use.
Therefore, “calibration,” as used in this manual,
actually means “adjustment.”
**= including the Signatories of the Agreement on
the European Economic Area
** = factory setting for standard balances with
a readability of ≤0.1mg and for verified
balances approved for use as legal measuring

Care and Maintenance
Servicing
Regular servicing of your balance by a Sartorius
technician will ensure its continued weighing
accuracy. Sartorius can offer you service contracts
with your choice of regular maintenance intervals
ranging from1month to 2 years.
Cleaning
Before cleaning the balance, unplug the AC adapter
from the wall outlet (mains supply).
Please do not use any aggressive cleaning agents
(solvents or similar agents). Instead, use a piece of
cloth which has been wet with a mild detergent (soap).
Make sure that no liquid enters the balance housing.
After cleaning, wipe down the balance with a soft,
dry piece of cloth.
Carefully remove any sample residue/spilled powder
by using a brush or a hand-held vacuum cleaner.
Make sure that no liquid or dust enters the crevice
surrounding the pan adapter.
Safety Inspection
If there is any indication that safe operation of the
balance with the AC adapter is no longer warranted,
turn off the power and disconnect the equipment
from AC power immediately. Lock the equipment in
a secure place to ensure that it cannot be used for the
time being.
Safe operation of the balance with the AC adapter
is no longer ensured when
– there is visible damage to the AC adapter
– the AC adapter no longer functions properly
– the AC adapter has been stored for a relatively long
period under unfavorable conditions
In this case, notify your nearest Sartorius Service
Center Unit. Only service technicians who are
authorized by Sartorius and who have access to the
required maintenance manuals are allowed to perform
maintenance and repairwork on the equipment.

Display Modes
You can select the display mode that best meets your individual accuracy
requirements (last numeral). The display increments possible are as follows:
1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, etc.
Starting with the basic increments of a weight unit, the display accuracy can
be reduced by as many as three levels so that you will obtain a faster readout with
a reduced display accuracy. The display accuracy is reduced proportionally to
the selected basic increment of a weight unit. To make this concept easier
to understand, the three levels are designated as “rounding factors” in the tables
summarizing the various menu code settings.

Utilities for Printouts or Data Transfer
Sartorius balances come standard with an interface. You can plug a Sartorius
printer or a computer into this interface port. In addition, you can choose to have
data output from your balance to this on-line device either automatically or by
pressing the pkey.
The balance operating menu lets you define the various parameters for data output.
Information on the data formats and for interfacing a computer or a different
peripheral device are available on request.
Data Output Parameter
This parameter is coupled with the stability parameter
Print on request = data is output only when the pkey is pressed or a software
command is received
Auto print = continuous, automatic data output

Automatic Taring after Data Output (Print on Request)
This convenient setting lets you checkweigh a series of samples or products
without having to unload the balance after each weighing operation.
– the sample remains on the pan after the weight readout has been printed
or transferred to an on-line computer
– the balance is tared automatically after the weight readout has been printed
or transferred to an on-line computer
– you simply load the next sample or part
Code

Data ID Codes
To help you identify weights, piece counts, percentages, etc., a code letter is
printed or displayed in front of these values. For example, an “N” printed
or displayed in front of a weight value identifies it as a net weight. If you set the
code for “without data ID code,” only net weights, results in percent and
counting results will be output. You will find the data ID codes for a particular
application program listed in the corresponding description.
The ID code increases the data output format for each weight readout
from16 to 22 characters.

Additional Functions
Menu Access Switch Function on Standard Balances
You can define the function of the menu access switch by setting the code for the
balance operating menu to “accessible.” The balance operating menu will then be
accessible at all times, which means that you can change the menu codes at any
time regardless of the setting of the menu access switch.
Access to the balance operating menu Code
Accessible 8 1 1
Depends on the setting of the menu access switch 8 1 2*
Menu Access Switch Function on Verified Balances
The balance operating menu can also be changed when the balance is being
used as a legal measuring instrument. Codes that are not permitted for operation
of the balance as a legal measuring instrument are blocked and cannot be
selected. For balances of accuracy class K, the menu access switch is adjusted
to lock the “External Calibration” function after verification. To do this, the switch
must be moved to the left. A control seal is affixed to the balance to lock the
menu access switch. Unauthorized attempts to remove this seal will irreversibly
damage it. If you break the seal, the validity of the verification will become
void, and you must have your balance re-verified.
Blocking the Keys
You can block all keys on the balance (except for e).

Power-On Mode
Depending on your requirements, you can change the power-on mode
of your balance.
The factory setting is: (power) off –> on <–> standby.
In this default setting, when you press the ekey (11) to turn off the display, the
balance will remain in the standby mode. This means that it will be ready
to operate without requiring any warmup when you turn the display back on.
In the setting “Toggle between on and standby,” the balance will automatically
turn on again after it has been temporarily disconnected from AC power
or a power failure has occurred.
In the setting “Automatic power-on,” the balance will automatically turn on again
after it has been temporarily disconnected from AC power, the ekey has
been pressed, or after a power failure has occurred. In this setting, you cannot
use the ekey to turn off the balance. If your balance is connected to a central
power supply that is switched off overnight, the balance will turn on automatically
the next day as soon as the power supply is switched on again.

A rule of thumb to go by for selecting the right setting to weigh animals is:
the more active an animal is, the greater the difference must be between two
successive subweights measured.
Depending on individual requirements, starting the averaging operation can be
delayed either in the automatic or manual mode until the animal you are weighing
has calmed down to a certain degree.
In this case, the start criterion is defined by the difference between two successive
subweights measured. If the animal moves, the start criterion is not met; therefore,
averaging will not start. Once the animal has calmed down, the program
checks whether two measured subweights are within the previously selected range.
If so, the actual averaging operation will be started.
Delay start until… Code
difference is slight 3 7 1
difference is average 3 7 2*
difference is considerable 3 7 3
During averaging, the number of subweighing operations left to perform is shown
on the weight display (countdown mode).
Changing the Number of Subweighing Operations
You can change the number of subweighing operations used to average
a weight. Change this number in cycles. You can choose from the following
settings: 5,10, 20, 50 and 100.
To activate the Hold down v(8)for more than 2 seconds until
change function: “rEF10” appears on the display
To change the setting: Briefly press v
If you enter a wrong number, press cto clear it
To store the number: Hold down vfor more than 2 seconds to store
this number permanently (in the non-volatile memory)
after you turn off the power
This setting is notcanceled by the reset code 9 – – 1°!

Storage Threshold for the Automatic Start Mode
To obtain an added measure of reliability in the automatic mode, in order to
avoid an “incorrect start,” a weight value must correspond to a minimum load
of 100 display increments.
Practical Example: Animal Weighing in the Automatic Start Mode
Menu code settings used in the example:

ISO/GLP-compliant Printout or Record
Application:
Use of the balance as a test and measuring instrument in quality assurance
systems in compliance with the requirements of ISO, GLP, GMP and EN (European
Standards) in which proof of the balance’s accurate performance is required.
The balance can record all completed calibration or adjustment operations and
print out data in compliance with the requirements of Good Laboratory
Practice (GLP). The balance, interfaced with a data printer or a computer, creates
a document that records the date, time, serial number and model number,
making it possible to clearly trace data to the balance that generated it and the
time at which it was generated.
Select the ISO/GLP-compliant printout or record mode by setting the respective
code in the balance operating menu:
ISO/GLP-compliant printout/record mode Code
Off 8 10 1*
Only for adjustment/calibration and linearization functions 8 10 2
Always on (e.g., for adjustment/calibration and linearization
functions, application programs, weight readouts) 8 10 3
The following menu code setting must be selected in order to obtain an ISO/GLP-
compliant printout/record:
With data ID code 7 2 2
!Important Note
ISO/GLP-compliant printouts/records will not be generated if the
factory setting, code 7 21, is selected. In addition, do not select the
“Auto print” data output parameter (code 614 or 615).
Operating the Balance with a Device That Has an ISO/GLP Printing
or Recording Capability
You can connect a special Sartorius Data Printer to Basicplusbalances for generating
ISO/GLP-compliant printouts (order no. YDP03-0CE).
To generate ISO/GLP-compliant records with a computer, you will need
special software. For information on writing this software, please ask Sartorius for
a detailed description.

Interface Description
General Information
This description has been written for users who wish
to connect their Sartorius balance, which has a built-in
V24/V28-RS-232C(-S)*)/423 interface port
as a standard feature, to a computer or a different
peripheral device.
By using an on-line computer, you can change,
activate and monitor the functions of the balance.
In addition, an external universal switch for remote
control of various functions can be connected to the
data interface port on the balance.
If you interface an original Sartorius accessory
device, such as a Sartorius Data Printer or a similar
unit, with a balance that has the factory-set menu
codes, you do not need to change any settings.
Interfacing Devices with the Balance
Please note that the interface port is electrically
connected to the protective grounding conductor
(protective earth = PE) of the balance housing.
The cabling supplied as accessory components is
shielded and electrically connected on both
ends to the cases of the connectors. This electrical
connection may result in interference caused by
ground loops or by transient currents if you have
grounded the housing or connected the protective
grounding conductor for AC power. If necessary,
connect an equipotential bonding conductor
to the balance.

Data Input Formats
Commands can be input via the balance interface port to control the
balance functions.
Control commands are distinguished according to those with upper-case letters,
or special characters, and those with lower-case letters.
Format for Control Commands
Control commands can include up to 13 characters.
Each character must be transmitted with a start bit, a 7-bit ASCII-coded character,
a parity bit and one or two stop bits.
You can define the parity, baud rate, handshake mode and the number of
stop bits by programming the respective codes in the balance operating menu
(see page 35).
Formats:
ESC K CR LF
ESC f X _ CR LF
ESC= Escape (ASCII 27)
K, f = Command characters (see following pages)
X = Number
_ = Underline (ASCII 95)
CR = Carriage return (ASCII 13)
LF = Line feed (ASCII 10)
The characters CR and LF do not have to be transmitted in the data string.
60

--- Page 61 ---
Control Commands with Upper-Case Letters or Special Characters
ESC P CR LF p(print; activate/block auto print)
ESC S CR LF Restart/self-test
ESC T CR LF Tare
ESC Z CR LF Internal calibration (adjustment)*
The “P,”“T” and “Z” commands do not affect the menu code settings of the
balance to reinitialize (turns the scale off and back on again). The “S” command
causes the processor to reintialize (turns the scale off and back on again).
The balance will operate according to the commands available up until the
processor is reinitialized. Once the balance has been turnedon,the processor will
always recognize the codes entered by the user in the balance operating menu.
ESC O CR LF Block the keys
ESC R CR LF Release the keys
Important Note
The pkey is not blocked!
Adaptation to Ambient Conditions
ESC K CR LF Very stable
ESC L CR LF Stable
ESC M CR LF Unstable
ESC N CR LF Very unstable
* = only for balances with a built-in automatic calibration weight
61

--- Page 62 ---
Control Commands with Lower-Case Letters
All functions that can be selected by pressing the respective keys on the balance
can also be activated by commands.
ESC f 0 _ CR LF v function key
ESC f 1 _ CR LF q function key
ESC s 3 _ CR LF c clear function
ESC x 0 _ CR LF Perform calibration test*
ESC x 1 _ CR LF Output scale model
ESC x 2 _ CR LF Output serial number
Each control command with the lower-case letters “f,” “s” and “x” must be
terminated by an underline (ASCII = 95).

Synchronization and Data Output Parameters
Definition
During data communication between the balance and an on-line device
(computer), “telegram-style” information consisting of ASCII characters is transmitted
by the interface.
For error-free data communication, the interface parameters, including the baud
rate, parity and handshake mode as well as the character format, must be the same
for both units.
You can change these parameters in the balance operating menu so that they
match those of the on-line device.
In addition to these parameter settings, you can define the data output parameter
of the balance so that data are transmitted depending on various conditions –
see “Utilities...” on page 36.
If you do not plug a peripheral device into the interface port on the balance, this
will not generate an error code. In this case, data will be output but not received.
Handshake
The balance interface (Sartorius Balance Interface = SBI) has a 23-byte transmit
buffer and a 40-byte receive buffer.
You can access the balance operating menu to define various handshake
parameters:
Software handshake: – controlled by “XOFF” and “XON”
Hardware handshake: – after “CTS” send 2 characters
– after “CTS” send 1 character
What happens when you define a software handshake?
Receiving device:
“XOFF” will not be transmitted until the receive buffer has stored the 26th character.
The enable command “XON” is given after the buffer has transmitted all characters
up to the 14th character.
If the device addressed does not understand the control command, the receiving
device continues to operate additionally with a hardware handshake after it has
received another 6 characters.
63

--- Page 64 ---
For data communication with a software handshake, “XON” must be sent
by a device when it is turned on in order to enable another on-line device to
exchange data.
Sequence:
Balance Receiving device
– – – – – byte – – – – →
– – – – – byte – – – – →
– – – – – byte – – – – →
– –←– – – <XOFF> – – – – –
– – – – – byte – – – – → (Once <XOFF> has been transmitted, a maximum
– – – – – byte – – – – → of 14 bytes can still be received.)
: :
: Pause :
: :
: :
– –←– – – <XON> – – – – – –
– – – – – byte – – – – →
– – – – – byte – – – – →
Transmitting device:
The importance of handshake control for data transmission becomes
especially apparent
– when the continuous automatic data output parameter is defined
– when data output is controlled by application programs
Once <XOFF> has been received, it prevents further transmission of characters.
When <XON> is received, it re-enables the transmitting device to send data.
The transmitting device is always enabled for sending data after it has been
switched on.
If data transmission is interrupted by the control line (CTS) or the command
<XOFF> while a data block is being output from an application program (only for
printing a section of text with several lines of data), the readout will be locked
into the display at the same time.
Data output will be blocked until the interface receives an enabling signal.
64

--- Page 65 ---
Activating a Data Output Process
You can define the data output parameter so that output is activated either
automatically or when a print command is received. You have two options for the
automatic mode: data output can be either synchronous with the balance display
or activated at defined intervals (to select the parameter, see the section entitled
“Utilities for Printouts or Data Transfer”).
Data Output by Print Command
The print command can be transmitted by a software command or by
pressing p.
In addition to an interface cable for a different device, you can connect an
external universal switch for remote control to the balance interface port (for the
print function, see page 35). For the switch, use pins 8 and 15 of this port and
a cable up to 1.5 m or 5 ft. long (RS-232C).
If data output is requested by a software command (see the section on “Data Input
Formats”), you can install a 15-m (50-ft.) cable for RS-232C.
Automatic Data Output
In the “auto print” operating mode, the data are output to the interface port without
requiring a print command. You can choose to have data output automatically at
defined print intervals with or without the stability parameter. Whichever parameter
you select, the data will be output as the readouts appear on the balance display.
If you select the auto print setting, data will be transmitted immediately the moment
you turn on the balance. This data output function is described under “Utilities...”
on page 36.
Higher Data Output Rates
If you require an output rate higher than 10 Hz, ask Sartorius for this information.

Declarations of Conformity
The CMark on Sartorius Equipment
In1985, the Council of the European Community
approved a resolution concerning a new approach to
the technical harmonization and standardization
of national regulations.
The organization for monitoring compliance with
the directives and standards concerning the

States through the implementation of the EC
Directives adopted by the respective national laws.
As of December1993, the scope of validity for
all EC Directives has been extended to the Member
States of the European Union and the Signatories
of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
Sartorius complies with the EC Directives and
European Standards in order to supply its customers
with weighing instruments that feature the latest
advanced technology and provide many years
of trouble-free service.
