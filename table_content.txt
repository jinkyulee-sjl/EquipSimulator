communicate using this format.
(cid:122) This format consists of fourteen characters excluding the terminator.
(cid:122) This format has no header characters.
(cid:122) The polarity sign is placed before the data, with spaces in place of leading zeros, if the data is
not zero or overloaded.
(cid:122) This format outputs the unit only for a stable value.
MT format 5if type 3
(cid:122) A header of two characters indicates the balance condition.
(cid:122) The polarity sign is used only for negative data.
(cid:122) The weighing data uses spaces in place of the leading zeros.
(cid:122) The character length of this format changes dependent upon the unit
NU (numerical) format 5if type 4
This format outputs only numerical data.
(cid:122) This format consists of nine characters excluding the terminator.
(cid:122) The polarity sign is placed before the data with the leading zeros. If the data is zero, the plus
sign is used.
CSV format 5if type 5
(cid:122) Separates the data of A&D standard format and the unit by a comma ( , ).
(cid:122) Outputs the unit even when the data is overloaded.
(cid:122) When ID number, data number, time and date are added, outputs ID number, data number,
date, time and weighing data in this order and separates each item by a comma and treats all
the items as one group of data.

15-3 Using Windows Communication Tools (WinCT)
When Windows is used as an operating system in a personal computer, the provided WinCT
software can be used to transmit the weighing data to the personal computer.
The WinCT software has two communication methods: “RsCom” and “RsKey”. For details on WinCT,
refer to the WinCT instruction manual.
RsCom
(cid:122) Can transmit commands to control the balance.
(cid:122) Can make bi-directional communication between the balance and a personal computer using
the RS-232C interface.
(cid:122) Can display or store the data using a text file format. Can also print the data using a printer
connected to the personal computer.
(cid:122) When several ports of a personal computer have balances connected, can communicate with
each balance simultaneously.
(cid:122) Can share a personal computer with other application software.
(cid:122) Can receive the balance GLP report.
RsKey
(cid:122) Can transmit the weighing data output from the balance directly to other application software
such as Microsoft Excel.
(cid:122) Can be used with most application software.
(cid:122) Can receive the balance GLP report.
Note
Windows and Excel are registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation.
15-4 Using the WinCT software, the balance can do the following:
1 Analyzing the weighing data and the statistics with “RsKey”
The weighing data can be input directly into an Excel worksheet. Then, Excel can analyze the
data to obtain total, average, standard deviation, maximum and minimum value, and display
them in a graph.
2 Controlling the balance using commands from a personal computer
By using “RsCom”, the personal computer sends commands such as “re-zero” or “send
weighing data” to the balance and controls the balance.
3 Printing the balance GLP report using your printer
The balance GLP report can be printed using a printer connected to the personal computer.
4 Receiving weighing data at a certain interval
The weighing data can be received at a certain interval and data characteristic with elapsed
time can be obtained.
5 Using the GP series balance memory function
The data can be stored in the balance’s memory. Of the data stored, the weighing data and
calibration data can be transmitted to a personal computer at one time.
6 Using a personal computer as an external indicator
With the “RsKey” test mode function, a personal computer can be used as an external weight
indicator for the balance. (To do this, set the balance data output mode to stream mode.)

16-2 Acknowledge Code and Error Codes
When the “Serial interface function (5if)” parameter is set to “erCd 1”, the balance outputs <AK>
code or error code to each command as follows:
<AK> (06h) Acknowledge in ASCII code.
(cid:122) When the balance receives a command to request data and can not process it, the balance
transmits an error code (EC, Exx).
When the balance receives a command to request data and can process it, the balance
outputs the data.
(cid:122) When the balance receives a command to control the balance and can not process it, the
balance transmits an error code (EC, Exx).
When the balance receives a command to control the balance and can process it, the balance
transmits the acknowledge code.
Among commands to control the balance, the following transmit the acknowledge code both
when the balance receives the command and when the balance has accomplished the
command. If the command can not be processed properly, the balance transmits an error code
(EC, Exx). This error can be released using the CAL command.
CAL command (Calibration command) ON command (Display ON command)
P command (Display ON/OFF command) R command (RE-ZERO command)
(cid:122) When a communication error has occurred due to external noise, or a parity error has occurred
due to transmission error, the balance transmits an error code. In this case, send the command
again.
16-3 Control Using CTS and RTS
Depending on the “Ct5” parameter of “Serial interface (5if)”, the balance performs as follows:
Ct5 0
Regardless of whether the balance can receive a command or not, the balance keeps the CTS line
HI. The balance outputs data regardless of the condition of the RTS line.
Ct5 1
The CTS line is kept Hi normally. When the balance can not receive the next command (e.g. while
the balance is processing last command), the balance sets the CTS line to Lo. The balance confirms
the level of the RTS line before outputting a set of data. If the RTS level is Hi, the balance outputs
data. If the RTS level is Lo, data is not output (The data is canceled).
16-4 Settings Related to RS-232C
Concerning the RS-232C, the balance has two functions: “Data output (dout)” and “Serial interface
(5if)”. Set each function as necessary.

17. MAINTENANCE
(cid:122) Do not disassemble the balance. Contact the local A&D dealer if the balance needs service or repair.
(cid:122) Use the original packing material for transportation.
(cid:122) Do not use organic solvents to clean the balance. Clean the balance with a lint free cloth that
is moistened with warm water and a mild detergent.
(cid:122) The mass of the internal mass may change due to corrosion or other damage caused by the operating
environment, or due to aging. Check the internal mass using an external weight periodically.
18. TROUBLESHOOTING
18-1 Checking the Balance Performance and Environment
The balance is a precision instrument. When the operating environment or the operating method is
inadequate, correct weighing can not be performed. Place a sample on the pan and remove it, and
repeat this several times. If the balance seems to have a problem with repeatability or to perform
improperly, check as described below. If improper performance persists after checking, contact the
local A&D dealer for repair.
Checking that the balance performs properly
(cid:122) Check the balance performance using the self-check function as described in “6-1 Automatic
Response Adjustment / Self Check Function”.
An error display appears when a malfunction is found.
(cid:122) Check the balance repeatability using an external weight. Be sure to place the weight in the
center of the weighing pan.
(cid:122) Check the balance repeatability, linearity and calibrated value using external weights with a
known value.
Checking that the operating environment or weighing method is proper
Operating environment
(cid:122) Is the weighing table solid enough?
(cid:122) Is the balance level? Refer to “3-1 Before Use”.
(cid:122) Is the operating environment free from vibration and drafts?
(cid:122) Is there a strong electrical or magnetic noise source such as a motor near the balance?
Weighing method
(cid:122) Is the weighing pan installed correctly?
(cid:122) Is the RE-ZERO key pressed before placing a sample on the weighing pan?
(cid:122) Is the sample placed in the center of the weighing pan?
(cid:122) Has the balance been calibrated using the internal mass (one-touch calibration)?
(cid:122) Has the balance been warmed up for 30 minutes before weighing?
