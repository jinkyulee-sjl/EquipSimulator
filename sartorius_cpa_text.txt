Seal on Balances Verified for Use
in Legal Metrology in the EU*:
EU legislation requires that a control
seal be affixed to verified balances of
accuracy class K. The control seal
consists of a sticker with the “Sartorius"
logo. If the seal is broken, the verifi-
cation becomes null and void and the
balance must be re-verified.

Connecting the Balance to AC Power/
Safety Precautions
$ Use only original Sartorius equipment.
The AC adapter meets the requirements of IP20 in
accordance with EN 60529.
$ For AC adapters with higher protection ratings
or for an external rechargeable battery pack, please
see “Accessories."
CPA26P, CPA225D:
(cid:2) Insert the right-angle plug from the AC adapter into
the jack on the electronics box.
All other balances with a weighing capacity
up to 10 kg:
(cid:2) Insert the right-angle plug from the AC adapter
into the jack on the balance.
(cid:2) Connect the AC adapter to an electrical outlet
(mains supply)
AC Adapter with Country-specific Power Cord
Some models come with separate country-specific
power cords for the AC adapter. In Europe, use only
original Sartorius AC adapter part no. 6971983.
§ Connect the angle plug to the balance/scale
§ Select the power cord for your area and connect it to
the AC adapter
§ Plug the power cord into the wall outlet (mains)
Connect the power cord to the AC adapter
(on balances with weighing capacities up to 10 kg)
$ Use an original Sartorius AC adapter with a wide input
voltage range (100 to 240 V~), order no. 6971966,
and replaceable power cord:
6900900 (Europe)
6900901 (US/CDN)

Balances with a Weighing Capacity over 10 kg:
(cid:2) Insert the right-angle plug into the jack and
tighten the screw.
(cid:2) Connect the AC adapter to an electrical outlet
(mains supply)
Safety Precautions
Plug-in AC Adapter:
The balance/scale is intended to be supplied by a
listed direct plug-in power unit marked “Class 2."
Universal AC Adapter 6971966:
The AC adapter rated to Class 1 can be plugged
into any wall outlet without additional safety
precautions.
The ground terminal is connected to the balance
housing, which can be additionally grounded
for operation. The data interface is also electrically
connected to the balance housing (ground).
Note:
This equipment has been tested and found to
comply with the limits pursuant to part 15 of FCC
Rules. These limits are designed to provide reason-
able protection against harmful interference. This
equipment generates, uses and can radiate radio
frequency energy and, if not installed and used in
accordance with these instructions, may cause
harmful interference to radio communications.
For information on the specific limits and class
of this equipment, please refer to the Declaration
of Conformity. Depending on the particular class,
you are either required or requested to correct the
interference.
11

--- Page 12 ---
If you have a Class A digital device, you need
to comply with the FCC statements as follows:
“Operation of this equipment in a residential area
is likely to cause harmful interference in which case
the user will be required to correct the interference
at his own expense.”
If you have a Class B digital device, please read and
follow the FCC information given below:
However, there is no guarantee that interference
will not occur in a particular installation. If this
equipment does cause harmful interference to radio
or television reception, which can be determined
by turning the equipment off and on, the user
is encouraged to try to correct the interference by
one or more of the following measures:
– Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
– Increase the separation between the equipment
and receiver.
– Connect the equipment into an outlet on
a circuit different from that to which the receiver
is connected.
– Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV
technician for help.
Before you operate this equipment, check which
FCC class (Class A or Class B) it has according
to the Declaration of Conformity included. Be sure
to observe the information of this Declaration.

Connecting Electronic Peripheral Devices
§ Make sure to unplug the balance from AC power
before you connect or disconnect a peripheral device
(printer or PC) to or from the interface port.
Warmup Time
To deliver exact results, the balance must warm up
as listed below after initial connection to AC power
or after a relatively long power outage.
– Model CPA2P…, CPA26P…: at least 4 hours
– All other precision and analytical models:
at least 30 minutes
Only after this time will the balance have reached
the required operating temperature.
Using Verified Balances in Legal Metrology:
$ Allow the equipment to warm up for at least
24 hours after initial connection to AC power.
Antitheft Locking Device on Balances with
a Weighing Capacity of up to 10 kg
(cid:2) To secure the balance at the place of installation,
fasten a chain or a lock to the lug located on the
rear panel of the balance (order no.: LC1).
13

--- Page 14 ---
Leveling the Balance
Purpose:
– To compensate for unevenness at the place
of installation
Leveling Balances with a Weighing Capacity
of up to 10 kg
Only the 2 front feet are adjusted to level the
balance.
§ Retract the two rear feet (only on models with
a rectangular weighing pan).
§ Turn the 2 front feet as shown in the diagram
until the air bubble is centered within the circle of
the level indicator.
> In most cases this will require several adjustment
steps.
§ For weighing heavy samples: Extend the 2 rear
feet until they touch the surface on which the
balance rests (only on models with a rectangular
weighing pan).
Leveling Balances with a Weighing Capacity
of over 10 kg
§ Adjust the leveling feet until the air bubble
is centered within the circle on the level indicator.

!Warning When Using Pre-wired RS-232 Connecting Cables:
RS-232 cables purchased from other manufacturers often have incorrect pin assignments
for use with Sartorius weighing systems. Be sure to check the pin assignments against

Repair work must be performed by
trained service technicians. Any attempt § Clean the balance using a piece of

by an incorrect type. Dispose of used
batteries according to the instructions. !Make sure that no liquid or other
foreign objects or dust (powder) enters
the balance housing.
!Do not use any aggressive cleaning
agents (solvents or similar agents).
Cleaning Stainless Steel Surfaces
Clean all stainless steel parts regularly.
Remove the stainless steel weighing
pan and thoroughly clean it separately.
Use a damp cloth or sponge to clean
any stainless steel parts on the balance
by wiping them down. You can use
any commercially available household
cleaning agent that is suitable for use
on stainless steel. Then wipe down the
equipment to rinse thoroughly, making
sure to remove all residues. Afterwards,
allow the balance to dry. If desired, you
can apply oil to the cleaned surfaces as
additional protection.
Solvents are permitted for use only on
stainless steel parts.
66

--- Page 67 ---
Cleaning the Weighing Chamber and Draft Shield
§ Open the draft shield cover and take out the
removable parts.
§ Use a hand-held vacuum cleaner and mini-hose
to remove any powdered sample material carefully.
§ Use blotting paper to remove any liquid sample
material.
§ On models with a 3-sided draft shield, pull the
3 draft shield walls upwards to remove, if necessary.
Safety Inspection
If there is any indication that safe operation of the
balance is no longer warranted:
§ Turn off the power and disconnect the equipment
from AC power immediately.
> Lock the equipment in a secure place to ensure
that it cannot be used for the time being.
Notify your nearest Sartorius Service Center.
Repair work must be performed by trained service
technicians.
We recommend having the power supply inspected
by a certified electrician at regular intervals,
according to the checklist given below:
– Insulating resistance: > 7 megaohms measured
with a constant voltage of at least 500 volts at
a 500 K-ohm load
– Leakage current: < 0.05mA measured with
a properly calibrated multimeter
